Prepare your environment as follows:
1. Configure host name resolution.
2. Disable the firewall and SELinux.
3. Configure time synchronization.
4 Download and Install Cephadm.
5. Configure the Yum source required by Ceph.
6. Install the container engine recommended by Ceph.
Step 1 Configure host names and host name resolution.
Set the host names of the three hosts to ceph01. novalocal, ceph02. novalocal, ceph03.
novalocal
Log in to all hosts and add the following content to the hosts file:
192.168.0.21 ceph01.novalocal ceph01
192.168.0.22 ceph02.novalocal ceph02
192.168.0.23 ceph03.novalocal ceph03
Then, ping each host name on ceph01 to ensure normal network communication.
ping ceph01
ping ceph02
ping ceph03

Step 2 Disable the firewall and SELinux.
Log in to all hosts and run systemctl disable firewalld to disable the firewall from
automatically starting upon system startup.
Then, disable SELinux.


Step 3 Configure time synchronization.
Run the following command on all hosts to install chrony and set it to automatically start
upon system startup:
yum install -y chrony
systemctl enable chronyd --now



Run chronyc sources to check the clock sources of the current ECS. Ensure that the clock
sources are the same before performing subsequent operations

Step 4 Download and install Cephadm.
This step only needs to be performed on one host. In this exercise, this step is performed
on ceph01.
Run the following command to download Cephadm adapted to openEuler:
git clone https://gitee.com/yftyxa/openeuler-cephadm.git
If the git command does not exist, install Cephadm manually.


Once it is downloaded, copy the Cephadm file to the /usr/sbin/ directory and grant the
execute permission to the file. The commands are as follows:
cp openeuler-cephadm/cephadm /usr/sbin && chmod a+x /usr/sbin/cephadm
After the installation is complete, confirm the Cephadm installation is correct by checking
the help information. The following figure shows the help information.

cephadm --help

Step 5 Add the Yum source required by Ceph.
Run the following commands on all hosts to add the Ceph Yum source:

cat >> /etc/yum.repos.d/ceph.repo <<EOF
[ceph]
name=ceph x86_64
baseurl=https://repo.huaweicloud.com/ceph/rpm-pacific/el8/x86_64
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
[ceph-noarch]
name=ceph noarch
baseurl=https://repo.huaweicloud.com/ceph/rpm-pacific/el8/noarch
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
[ceph-source]
name=ceph SRPMS
baseurl=https://repo.huaweicloud.com/ceph/rpm-pacific/el8/SRPMS
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
EOF


Step 6 Install the container engine recommended by Ceph.
Run the following commands on all hosts to add the Yum source required by the
container engine:
wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo https://repo.huaweicloud.com/repository/conf/CentOS-8-
reg.repo
Run the following commands to install the corresponding container engine:
yum install podman-3.3.1-9.module_el8.5.0+988+b1f0b741.x86_64 lvm2 -y
During the installation, if there is a software package conflict, uninstall the software
packages and then continue the installation. Once installed, set the container engine to
start upon system startup.
Then, restart all ECS hosts
