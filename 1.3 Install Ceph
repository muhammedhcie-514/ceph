After the ECSs are restarted, install and deploy the Ceph cluster.
Step 1 Initialize the Ceph cluster on ceph01.
Run the following commands to initialize the Ceph cluster:
cephadm bootstrap --mon-ip 192.168.0.21 --allow-fqdn-hostname --initial-dashboard-user admin --
initial-dashboard-password Huawei@123 --dashboard-password-noupdate
After the initialization is complete, the system returns the graphical login interface of the
cluster. See the following figure.
it gives us a url

Use the EIP bound to ceph01 to log in to the Ceph web page. See the following figure.

Step 2 Add a node to the cluster.
Create a Ceph management container.
cephadm shell


Generate a cluster public key and copy it to the remaining hosts.
ceph cephadm get-pub-key > ~/ceph.pub
ssh-copy-id -f -i ~/ceph.pub root@ceph02.novalocal
ssh-copy-id -f -i ~/ceph.pub root@ceph03.novalocal


When adding the key, enter the password of the root user of the host as prompted. See
the following figure.


Add all hosts to the cluster.
ceph orch host add ceph02.novalocal
ceph orch host add ceph03.novalocal

After the hosts are added, check the host status in the current cluster.
ceph orch host ls


Wait for the system to automatically deploy services to all nodes. After the deployment is
complete, the status is as follows:

ceph orch ls


Step 3 Initialize the Ceph cluster.
Disable the automatic extension function of the MON daemon.
[root@ceph01 ~]# ceph orch apply mon --unmanaged=true
Scheduled mon update...
Once disabled, the value of PLACEMENT corresponding to mon changes to unmanaged.
See the following figure.
ceph orch ls


Add the _admin label to ceph02 and ceph03.
[root@ceph01 ~]# ceph orch host label add ceph02.novalocal _admin
Added label _admin to host ceph02.novalocal
[root@ceph01 ~]# ceph orch host label add ceph03.novalocal _admin
Added label _admin to host ceph03.novalocal
Deploy the MON and MGR components on the specified node.
[root@ceph01 ~]# ceph orch apply mon --placement="label:_admin"
Scheduled mon update...
[root@ceph01 ~]# ceph orch apply mgr --placement="label:_admin"
Scheduled mgr update...
ceph orch host ls




Step 4 Add OSDs.
Add the hard disks on all hosts as OSDs.
ceph orch apply osd --all-available-devices

Run ceph orch ps to display the components on all hosts.
